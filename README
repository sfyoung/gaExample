In this experiment, you can evolve an image of
100*100 pixels.
This experiment is achieved with Qt.

You can find it is easy to use it:
1.Click "Open" button to choose an image(100*
100 pixels).
2.Click "Begin" button to begin.

Compile:
Qt Version is 4.8.4, Fedora 18, kernel 3.8.0
After Changing to this directory:
1.qmake-qt4 -project
